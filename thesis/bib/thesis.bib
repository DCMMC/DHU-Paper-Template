	abstract = {Detecting and recognizing text in natural scene images is a challenging, yet not completely solved task. In recent years several new systems that try to solve at least one of the two sub-tasks (text detection and text recognition) have been proposed. In this paper we present SEE, a step towards semi-supervised neural networks for scene text detection and recognition, that can be optimized end-to-end. Most existing works consist of multiple deep neural networks and several pre-processing steps. In contrast to this, we propose to use a single deep neural network, that learns to detect and recognize text from natural images, in a semi-supervised way. SEE is a network that integrates and jointly learns a spatial transformer network, which can learn to detect text regions in an image, and a text recognition network that takes the identified text regions and recognizes their textual content. We introduce the idea behind our novel approach and show its feasibility, by performing a range of experiments on standard benchmark datasets, where we achieve competitive results.},

The task is to detect and correct grammatical errors that occurred in Chinese essays written by non-native speakers of Mandarin Chinese. Our system is mainly based on the convolutional sequence-to-sequence model. We regard GEC as a translation task from the language of ``bad'' Chinese to the language of ``good'' Chinese. We describe the building process of the model in details. On the test data of NLPCC 2018 Shared Task 2, our system achieves the best precision score, and the {\$}{\$}F{\_}{\{}0.5{\}}{\$}{\$}score is 29.02. Our final results ranked third among the participants.",
